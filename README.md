# Alfie

A List of Facts and Information ('til I find a better backronym).

Alfie is a web-application that centralises eclectic documentation and
resources in one user-friendly page.

At first glance, it may seem like a good old web directory.  
However, in places where it can, Alfie will render the documents properly.
Alfie will allow to export all documents related to a project in one click.

The aim is to hook [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) up to convert and store the
documents in one unified format.
